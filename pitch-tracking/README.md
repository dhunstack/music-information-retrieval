# Music Information Retrieval

## Pitch Tracking

In this task, we focus on pitch tracking, i.e. automatically figuring out the  "hums" of the tune.

We'll use deep-learning-based open source pitch tracker (CREPE). We want to see how well it works on different instruments and in various music styles, and assess the decoding of notes with and without Viterbi decoding.
