# Music Information Retrieval

## Beat and Downbeat Tracking

We'll work on finding the beat and downbeat in a  music piece. Think of the beat as the regular tapping of your foot when you listen to a song, and the downbeat is that tap or clap that starts a music pattern, the first beat of a bar.

We'll make two tools to find the beat. The first tool uses signal processing techniques, while the second tool uses machine learning (in particular deep learning).

In the end, we'll see which tool does better by checking their scores using f-measure. We'll also see if some types of songs (like rock or jazz) or tempo (fast or slow) make it harder or easier for these tools to find the beat.
