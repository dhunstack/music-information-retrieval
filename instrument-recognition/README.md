## Sound Classification for Instrument Recognition

We will explore the task of recognizing musical instruments based solely on their sound profiles. This involves distinguishing the nuanced tonal characteristics that each instrument produces, such as the sharp resonance of a violin versus the deep hum of a cello or the distinct timbre of a flute compared to a clarinet.

Starting from an available dataset of samples from different instruments, we will extract timbre-related features from the audio. Once processed, the data will be segmented into training, validation, and testing sets to ensure the model's robustness and generalization capabilities.

Using a simple model, we will analyze and critique its performance, trying to explain its behaviour to be able to improve it in the future.
